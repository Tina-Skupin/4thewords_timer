# 4thewords attack modification and timer converter

In the gamification app "4thewords", you fight monsters by typing words. It is mainly geared towards writers. However- what do those writers do when you are not writing words, but changing words, editing words? This time we want to use for kicking more monsters as well. The writer community came up with a way to deal with this: The approximate change rate words/ time is considered 1000 words written equals 1 hour of editing. (This number has never been proven as far as I know, but we all use it. Just run with it.)

So, all problems solved? Not so fast. The thing is, you can get attack bonuses (for example by gathering weapons, armour or a familiar. It is an gamification app), and then you need less words for beating a monster. And the fun is to know: only x more words/minutes, and I have beaten this mob.
That's where this app comes in.Just put in your attack and the strength of the monster, and it will show you how many minutes you need. Even more, it will automatically set up a timer. When the time is up, it will give you a sum of total minutes battled this day, and create a lorem ipsum document to directly copy into the Webpage.
